        party licensors (“Licensors”). Licensee shall not reverse engineer or
        decompile the model, data or software contained in the Service, compile
        the source code or data, or modify or enhance the software or data.

        products and services, either jointly with one or more of the Service
        Providers, with other third parties, and/or independently. The Service
        Providers and such third-party investors/business partners may also: (i)
        use Feedback in aggregated, anonymized format for any lawful purpose;
        (ii) share Feedback with its/their respective affiliates and successors,
        and third-party service providers and/or business partners, in
        connection with the above-described uses; and (iii) share Feedback in
        connection with the sale, assignment, merger or other transfer of
        its/their respective business(es), as applicable. Such third parties
        will be subject to contractual confidentiality requirements. NO
        WARRANTY. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot;, “AS
