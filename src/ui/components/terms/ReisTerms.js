      <p>
        LICENSE TYPE. The Service is jointly offered by Moody’s Analytics, Inc.
        and its licensors, as applicable (collectively, the &quot;Service
        Providers&quot;) either: (i) on a limited basis for evaluation purposes
        only (&quot;Evaluation License&quot;), or (ii) under a commercial
        license for internal production or research use (&quot;Commercial
        License&quot;). A Commercial License is only granted by the Service
        Providers pursuant to a separate written agreement with Licensee, in
        which case such separate written agreement shall govern Licensee’s
        access and use of the Service and this Agreement shall not apply. If no
        separate written agreement between all or any of the Service Providers
        and Licensee is in effect, Licensee’s access and use of the Service
        shall be deemed an Evaluation License and shall be governed by the terms
        of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        EVALUATION PERIOD. Licensee has been provided with access to the Service
        for an evaluation period specified in a separate email communication or
        otherwise communicated by the Service Providers in their sole discretion
        (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;).
      </p>
      <p>
        EVALUATION LICENSE. For the duration of the Evaluation Period only, the
        Service Providers grant Licensee a limited, nonexclusive,
        nontransferable license, without right of sublicense, to access and use
        the Service for evaluation purposes only.
      </p>
      <p>
        OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS. All rights, including patent, copyright,
        database, and trade secret and other intellectual property and
        proprietary rights, in the Service, including the models, software and
        data therein, accompanying documentation, and all versions, updates,
        enhancements, fixes, and modifications to any and all of the foregoing,
        shall remain in the Service Providers’ and any of their respective third
        party licensors (&quot;Licensors&quot;). Licensee shall not reverse
        engineer or decompile the model, data or software contained in the
        Service, compile the source code or data, or modify or enhance the
        software or data. Licensee shall not allow any third parties, including
        its customers, borrowers, consultants, independent contractors, or
        agents, to use the Service, or any information derived from them.
        Licensee shall be responsible for any unauthorized disclosure, or other
        breach of this Agreement by its employees, agents or contractors. Other
        than the limited license rights expressly granted above, all rights are
        reserved to the Service Providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        FEEDBACK. By accessing and/or using the Service, Licensee expressly
        consents to the use of Feedback as defined and described herein.
        &quot;Feedback&quot; means any and all ideas, feedback, suggestions, and
        other input (by way of example only, about how to improve the Service),
        as well as other submissions, commentary, and other information
        (including any personal data or information such as name, address, and
        IP address(es) contained therein) uploaded, transmitted, stored, or
        otherwise provided by or on behalf of Licensee in connection with
        Licensee’s use of the Service. Licensee grants to each of the Service
        Providers, the non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual,
        transferable, sublicensable, and royalty-free license and right (but not
        the obligation) to copy, adopt, display, transmit, publish, distribute,
        modify, create derivative works based on, and otherwise use or act on
        the Feedback in connection with the Service Provider’s business
        purposes, without additional approval or consideration, in any form,
        media, or technology now known or later developed. Feedback may be
        stored, processed, and used by Service Providers and their respective
        affiliates in connection with providing, maintaining, and supporting the
        Service (for example, to improve user experience and/or tailor user
        interaction with the Service), and for other related purposes. The
        Service Providers and their respective affiliates may share Feedback
        with third-party investors and business partners (and their respective
        affiliates) to provide products and services, and such third parties may
        also use Feedback to provide products and services, either jointly with
        one or more of the Service Providers, with other third parties, and/or
        independently. The Service Providers and such third-party
        investors/business partners may also: (i) use Feedback in aggregated,
        anonymized format for any lawful purpose; (ii) share Feedback with
        its/their respective affiliates and successors, and third-party service
        providers and/or business partners, in connection with the
        above-described uses; and (iii) share Feedback in connection with the
        sale, assignment, merger or other transfer of its/their respective
        business(es), as applicable. Such third parties will be subject to
        contractual confidentiality requirements. NO WARRANTY. THE SERVICE IS
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot;, &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS WITHOUT
        ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. NONE OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS OR ANY
        OF THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
        REGARDING THE SERVICE OR ANY PART OR COMPONENT THEREOF, EXPRESS OR
        IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.
        THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS DO NOT GUARANTEE
        THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY, AVAILABILITY, OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY DATA OR
        INFORMATION DISPLAYED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, OR THAT ANY SUCH DATA
        OR INFORMATION WILL BE ERROR-FREE.
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS OR
        THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR
        DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE
        SERVICE, WHETHER RESULTING FROM TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF
        CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER FORM OF ACTION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
        DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
        (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
        OF SUCH DAMAGE.
